I'll break down each section of utils.py and explain its purpose and functionality:

1. **Imports and Global Configuration**
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ddsp
import ddsp.core
import tensorflow as tf
import os

# Audio configuration
SAMPLE_RATE = 16000  # Can be modified based on needs

# Create outputs directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs('tutorials/01_core_functions/outputs', exist_ok=True)
```
- Sets up necessary libraries for audio processing, visualization, and file operations
- Defines configurable sample rate (16kHz is standard for DDSP)
- Creates output directory for saving audio files

2. **Audio Playback and Saving**
```python
def play_audio(audio, sample_rate=SAMPLE_RATE, demo_name="output"):
```
- Primary function for saving audio output files
- Handles both TensorFlow tensors and NumPy arrays
- Provides information about the audio (sample rate, shape, amplitude range)
- Saves audio in WAV format to the outputs directory

3. **Spectrogram Visualization**
```python
def specplot(audio, sample_rate=SAMPLE_RATE):
```
- Creates a visual representation of audio frequency content over time
- Automatically converts stereo to mono if needed
- Uses scipy's spectrogram function with these parameters:
  - n_fft=2048: Size of the FFT window (frequency resolution)
  - hop_length=512: Number of samples between successive frames (time resolution)
- Displays:
  - X-axis: Time in seconds
  - Y-axis: Frequency in Hz
  - Color: Magnitude in dB (brighter = stronger)

4. **Transfer Function Analysis**
```python
def transfer_function(audio, sample_rate=SAMPLE_RATE):
```
- Calculates the frequency response of an audio signal
- Handles 1D, 2D, and 3D inputs by reshaping to [batch, time, channels]
- Uses FFT with 2048 points to convert time domain to frequency domain
- Returns:
  - frequencies: Array of frequency points from 0 to Nyquist (sample_rate/2)
  - magnitudes: Strength of each frequency component
- Useful for analyzing filters and effects

5. **Impulse Response Visualization**
```python
def plot_impulse_responses(impulse_response, desired_response=None, sample_rate=SAMPLE_RATE):
```
- Creates a two-panel plot showing:
  - Left panel: Time-domain impulse response
  - Right panel: Frequency response (using transfer_function)
- Can optionally show a desired response for comparison
- Useful for filter design and analysis
- Helps visualize how a filter or effect modifies the frequency content

6. **Audio Normalization**
```python
def normalize_audio(audio, target_peak=0.8):
```
- Scales audio to prevent clipping
- Default target peak of 0.8 provides headroom
- Works with both TensorFlow tensors and NumPy arrays
- Important for maintaining consistent audio levels across different effects

7. **Signal Smoothing**
```python
def smooth(signal, window_size=100):
```
- Applies moving average smoothing to a signal
- Useful for:
  - Smoothing control signals
  - Reducing artifacts in parameter modulation
  - Creating gradual transitions
- Window size determines amount of smoothing (larger = smoother)

These utilities provide the foundation for:
1. Creating audio examples
2. Visualizing results
3. Analyzing the effects of different processing techniques
4. Ensuring consistent audio quality

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these sections or move on to implementing one of the demo files?
