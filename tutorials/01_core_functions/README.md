# DDSP Core Functions Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates the core DDSP functions used to build synthesizers and processors.

## Structure
- `utils.py`: Shared utilities for audio playback and visualization
- `01_oscillators.py`: Examples of audio generation using oscillators
- `02_filters.py`: Examples of audio filtering techniques
- `03_delays.py`: Examples of delay-based effects

## Running the Examples
Each Python file can be run independently:
```bash
python 01_oscillators.py
python 02_filters.py
python 03_delays.py
```

## Expected Outputs
Audio files will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

## Concepts Covered
[TODO: Add detailed explanations of DSP concepts demonstrated in each file]
